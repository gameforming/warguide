  <h1>Getting Started with Warhammer 40,000</h1>
  <p>
    Warhammer 40,000, commonly known as Warhammer 40K or simply 40K, is a tabletop miniature wargame produced by Games Workshop. Set in a dystopian science-fantasy universe in the distant future, it combines deep strategy, rich lore, and stunning miniatures.
  </p>
  <p>
    To begin playing, you first need to assemble and paint your army of miniatures. Each army represents one of many factions in the game, ranging from the noble Space Marines to the savage Orks or the mysterious Eldar. The game is played on a tabletop battlefield, where players take turns moving their units, shooting weapons, and engaging in close combat.
  </p>
  <p>
    The core gameplay revolves around collecting points for your army, which helps balance matches between players. Armies are built by selecting units with specific abilities, weapons, and point values. Players then deploy their forces strategically to outmaneuver and defeat their opponents.
  </p>
  <p>
    Warhammer 40K also offers a vast and detailed universe filled with compelling stories and characters. Exploring the lore can greatly enrich your gaming experience and help you connect with your chosen faction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you're a casual hobbyist or a competitive player, Warhammer 40K offers a rewarding blend of tactical gameplay and creative expression. Start small, learn the rules step-by-step, and most importantlyâ€”have fun commanding your armies on the grim battlefield of the 41st millennium!
