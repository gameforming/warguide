      overview: `Warhammer 40,000 is a turn-based tabletop game where players command armies of miniatures across a battlefield. Each turn consists of several phases, including movement, shooting, and close combat, with the goal of completing mission objectives and defeating your opponent's forces.`,

      armyBuilding: `Players build their armies by selecting units and wargear to match a points limit. Each unit has a specific points cost, and balanced armies are crucial for fair gameplay.`,

      movement: `During the Movement Phase, players move their units across the battlefield. Different units have varying movement speeds and special abilities affecting movement.`,

      shooting: `In the Shooting Phase, units that have ranged weapons can fire at enemy units within range and line of sight. Players roll dice to determine hits and damage.`,

      charge: `The Charge Phase allows units to attempt a charge move to engage enemy units in close combat. Successful charges can disrupt the opponent's plans.`,

      fight: `The Fight Phase resolves close combat between engaged units. Players alternate attacking and defending, rolling dice to determine outcomes.`,

      morale: `The Morale Phase tests the discipline of units that have taken casualties. Failed morale checks can cause units to flee or suffer additional penalties.`
